[00:26.13] Let me tell y'all what it's like
[00:28.74] Being male, middle-class and white
[00:31.14] It's a bitch, if you don't believe
[00:33.54] Listen up to my new CD, sha-mon
[00:49.04] 
[00:46.20] I got shit runnin' through my brain
[00:48.90] So intense that I can't explain
[00:51.49] All alone in my white-boy pain
[00:53.87] Shake your booty while the band complains
[01:14.37] 
[01:05.47] I'm rockin' the suburbs, just like Michael Jackson did
[01:10.44] I'm rockin' the suburbs, except that he was talented
[01:15.54] I'm rockin' the suburbs, I take the checks and face the facts
[01:20.55] That some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracks
[01:50.55] 
[01:36.72] I'm pissed off but I'm too polite
[01:39.37] When people break in the McDonald's line
[01:41.98] Mom and Dad, you made me so uptight
[01:44.50] I'm gonna cuss on the mic tonight
[02:01.00] 
[01:47.25] I don't know how much I can take
[01:51.91] Girl, give me something I can break
[02:09.41] 
[01:55.97] I'm rockin' the suburbs, just like Quiet Riot did
[02:00.97] I'm rockin' the suburbs, except that they were talented
[02:06.07] I'm rockin' the suburbs, I take the checks and face the facts
[02:11.07] That some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracks
[02:41.07] 
[02:26.33] In a haze these days, I pull up to the stop light
[02:31.30] I can feel that something's not right
[02:34.03] I can feel that someone's blasting me with hate and bass
[02:39.00] Sendin' dirty vibes my way
[02:41.42] 'Cause my great-great-great-great-grandad
[02:44.04] Made someone's great-great-great-great-granddaddies slaves
[02:49.05] It wasn't my idea
[02:51.74] It wasn't my idea
[02:53.81] Never was my idea
[02:56.46] I just drove to the store for some Preparation-H
[03:20.46] 
[03:12.59] Y'all don't know what it's like
[03:15.46] Being male, middle-class and white
[03:17.89] Y'all don't know what it's like
[03:20.57] Being male, middle-class and white
[03:22.85] Y'all don't know what it's like
[03:25.38] Being male, middle-class and white
[03:27.95] Y'all don't know what it's like
[03:30.52] Being male, middle class and white
[03:32.13] It gets me real pissed off and it makes me wanna say
[03:34.89] It gets me real pissed off and it makes me wanna say
[03:37.47] It gets me real pissed off and it makes me wanna say
[03:40.34] Fuck!
[03:42.84] 
[03:44.77] Just like Jon Bon Jovi did
[03:47.16] I'm rockin' the suburbs, except that he was talented
[03:52.14] I'm rockin' the suburbs, I take the checks and face the facts
[03:57.11] That some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracks these days
[04:32.61] 
[04:05.67] Yeah, yeah, I'm rockin' the suburbs
[04:10.61] Yeah, yeah, I'm rockin' the suburbs
[04:15.67] Yeah, yeah
[04:20.67] 
[04:25.94] You better look out because I'm gonna say 'Fuck'
[04:28.29] You better look out because I'm gonna say 'Fuck'
[04:30.92] You better look out because I'm gonna say 'Fuck'
