You can try your
best to play it off and
take it on the chin
You can try to wrap your
head around the
feeling that you're in
But you're lost
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
But you're lost
You could pull the wool
over your eyes and blame it
on the stars
Put your ceiling on the
county line and sit upon
the sparks
Till they're gone
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Till they're gone
But I heard from the suburbs
That you wanna
Leave the pack
Cold feet in the summer
(Yeah, yeah)
You're a runner
(Yeah, yeah)
And you're fast
So, don't you let 'em
hold you back
Yeah, yeah
Is it stuck in your heart?
Is it stuck in your head?
Is it stuck in your throat?
If it's more than a dream
All you wanted to be,
but you're letting it go
You're letting it go
If you think that you know
what you want
Don't go biting your tongue
till you leave it too late
But I heard from the suburbs
(Yeah, yeah)
That you wanna
(Yeah, yeah)
Leave the pack
Cold feet in the summer
(Yeah, yeah)
You're a runner
(Yeah, yeah)
And you're fast
So, don't you let 'em
hold you back
Yeah, yeah
So, don't you let 'em
hold you back
Yeah, yeah
If you think that you know
what you want
Don't go biting your tongue
till you leave it too late
If you think that you know
what you want
Don't go biting your tongue
