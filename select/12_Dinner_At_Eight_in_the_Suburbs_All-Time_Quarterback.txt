This is the proper place where I'm growing older without grace
And all of the people seem contented with the urban routine

'Cause the backdrop fell on my closing evening
And the actresses left for the farewell party

And I left the timberline for oil slicks and parking fines
And I found that its too late to read you the lease at 113A Ellis

All the punker kids need to be home by 7
Cause there's dinner at eight in the suburbs
With sister and father and mother
I wanted to end it there, to save myself for once and for all
But it turns out, its not that good
Now I'm stuck, summer turns to fall

This is the proper place where I'm growing older without grace
And all of the people seem contented with the urban routine
