Singing some stupid hate songs,
In my mind I can hear them now.
Braces on 40 year faces,
In my mind I can see them now.
And you wanted to by some action
But it was a bit too loud.
Move back to the suburbs with me
My dear, we'll make a new home
Full of warmth and cheer.
'Cause to many arseholes
Have moved in here.
Move back to the suburbs.
Prizes for advertising,
In my mind I can see them now.
Poseurs speak down their noses,
In my mind I can hear them now.
I'm gonna flick a match over
My shoulder as I leave this town
Move back to the suburbs with me
My dear, we'll make a new home
Full of warmth and cheer.
'Cause to many arseholes
Have moved in here.
Move back to the suburbs.
I'm gonna flick a match over
My shoulder as I leave this town
Move back to the suburbs with me
My dear, we'll make a new home
Full of warmth and cheer.
'Cause to many arseholes
Have moved in here.
Move back to the suburbs.
Move Back To the Suburbs. [x4]
